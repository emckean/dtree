draft documentation outline

qtl = QuesTreL Template Library
(meant to suggest an analogy with the Standard Template Library, std::)
(The name of the STL is called std,
which of course isn't what it really is.
And the qtl is my own invention)


A qtl::container object is analogous to a std::container object
where container is a string or scalar or vector<container> or tuple<container...>
The only methods that have been implemented are the ones that we needed for this project
generally, conversion to/from the correspoinding std::container, read only forward iterators, and push_back
todo: add more std::methods to support other uses
All containers are stored as strings, and are comparable with memcmp
scalars can contain long or double or decfloat.
todo: full support for decfloat arithmetic
scalars take up as much space as needed for the required precision,
but try to be compact for values that could be represented in small types (char/short/half float)
arithmetic and comparison operators don't care about the type of object they operate on,
but are not expected to give sensible results if you do arithmetic on strings 
or comparisons between scalars and strings

Intervals represent a range of scalar or string values.
Intervals are represented by their boundaries.
Boundary points are not scalar or string values, but fall between values
(thus there is no need to distinguish whether an interval between boundaries includes or excludes its end points)
Arithmetic on intervals yields an interval
todo: support interval versions of <cmath> functions
Dividing by an interval that contains 0 yields an interval that contains the projective infinity
(which is equivalent to the complement of a conventional finite interval,
and is represented by an upper boundary that is less than the lower boundary)
comparisons between intervals can yield True, False, or Maybe
Logical operators on True/False/Maybe use a 3 valued logic system.
(Logical operators also work on intervals)

todo: verify that interval<object> works on arbitrary totally ordered objects, not just qtl::string and qtl::scalar
and that interval arithmetic works on any ordered field.


Rows in the database are tuples of values that can be strings or scalars that are stored in strings.
Nodes in the database are tuples of intervals of values

Using interval arithmetic and 3 valued logic, an arbitrary predicate can be evaluated on a node
to determine whether the node, and the values in the node do/don't/maybe satisfy the predicate.
When a node doesn't satisfy the predicate, it can be skipped.
When a node does satisfy the predicate, no further tests need be done on values within the node,
todo: in the case of aggregate queries (count, sum, avg, variance, standard deviation, max, min, median, ...)
  a cached value can be returned immediately without need to descend within the node to find the individual values.
When values within a node may satisfy the predicate, it can be descended to find nodes with narrower intervals,
until the predicate can be reduced to True or False

todo: compress common prefix of boundaries of an interval
todo: compress common prefix of boundary partitions within a node
todo: support the above with a general shared prefix for qtl::string objects

todo: class ranges:public std::variant<interval,std::vector<ranges>>{}
      to support values that represent nested containers,
      and change nodes to tuples of ranges instead of just tuples of intervals
      But extending interval arithmetic to ranges arithmtic impiles container arithmetic,
      so maybe we just need a notation for binding varibles to container elements
      
nodes are internal implementation details not normally visible to the c++ user
the interface to the user looks more like a map with a generalized index
e.g. the equivalent of
  INSERT INTO table_name VALUES 'Column 1', 'Column 2', 'string value', 'then some numbers', 1, 2, 3.14159, 'then another string';
might be
  map[{"table_name"_s}] = {"Column 1"_s, "Column 2"_s, "string value"_s, "then some numbers"_s, 1, 2, 3.14159, "then another string"_s};
but using column 0 as a table name is just a convention that the user may choose to adopt (say, when implementing an sql database)
our class doesn't care, so the above insert would also have been equivalent to
  map[{}] = {"table_name"_s, "Column 1"_s, "Column 2"_s, "string value"_s, "then some numbers"_s, 1, 2, 3.14159, "then another string"_s};
or
  map[{"table_name"_s, "Column 1"_s}][{"Column 2"_s}] = {"string value"_s, "then some numbers"_s, 1, 2, 3.14159, "then another string"_s};
or
  map[{"table_name"_s,"Column 1"_s, "Column 2"_s, "string value"_s, "then some numbers"_s, 1, 2, 3.14159, "then another string"_s}] = {};
the value could be deleted with
  map[{"table_name"_s,"Column 1"_s, "Column 2"_s, "string value"_s, "then some numbers"_s, 1, 2, 3.14159, "then another string"_s}] = nullptr;
the index could also be an arbitrary predicate, so
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE 'then' <= column(4) and column(5) + column(6) < column(7);
might be written as
  for( auto row:map[{"table_name"_s}][ "then"_s <= 4_column && 5_column + 6_column < 7_column ] ){
    std::cout << row << std::endl; // but unlike the sql query, this print statement would include table_name as column(0)
  }

Expressions can be bound to a symbol table to resove names
e.g. given
  std::map<std::string,qtl::expr>symtab={
    {"const"s,         "then"_s},
    {"four"s,          4_column},
    {"five"s,          5_column},
    {"six"s,           6_column},
    {"five_plus_six"s, "five"_name + "six"_name}
    {"seven"s,         7_column},
  };
one could write
  ( "const"_name <= "four"_name && "five_plus_six" < "seven"_name ).bind(symtab)
for
  "then"_s <= 4_column && 5_column + 6_column < 7_column


notation:
The user defined suffix qtl::literals::operator""_s, can be used to create qtl::string literals,
  "string"_s
analogous to std::literals::string_literals::operator""s 
or qtl::scalar literals
  123_s
analogous to to 123l or 123f

the interval {x : a < x <= b} "x such that x is greater than a and less than or equal to b"
can be written as
  a < x::x <= b
the right-unbounded interval {x : a <= x} can be written as
  a <= x::x
the left-unbounded interval {x : x < b} can be written as
  x::x < b
note: when a < b, (a <= x::x && x::x < b) is the same as (a <= x::x < b)

The interval containing the single point a {x : a <= x <= a} or {x : x == a} can also be written as
  x::x==a
or as
  x::x[a]
or just 
  a
when context makes it clear that an interval is being used

The projectively wrapped interval {x : x <= a || b < x } i.e. the complement of {x : a < x <= b} can be written as
  x::x <= a || b < x::x 

(the above interval notations are also recognized by the test SQL parser)

In C++ only, a boundary <a can be written as 
  x::x | a
or as
   --a
A boundary >a can be written as
  a | x::x
or as 
  a++

if lower and upper are boundaries, the interval between them can also be written as
  (lower,upper)
so (a|x::x, x::x|b) and (a++, --b) and (a < x::x < b) are equivalent
also, (x::x|a, a|x::x) and (--a, a++) and (a <= x::x <= a) and (x::x==a) and (x::x[a]) are equivalent

x::x is a magic constant with a magic type that allows us to appropriately overload operators
(x::x<a) is meant to suggest the { x : x < a } "x such that x is less than a" set-builder notation <https://www.google.com/search?q=set+builder+notation>

(a < x::x < b) is the same as (a<x::x && x::x<b),
not the same as (a<x::x) < x::x[b]
even though in other expression contexts b might be implicitly converted to x::x[b]
( a<b is the same as x::x[a] < x::x[b] )
Which means that (a<x::x) is actually another magic type with an implicit conversion to qtl::interval 


(x::x|a) and (a|x::x) boundaries are meant to suggest Dedekind cuts or Surreal Numbers

Those analogies seem familar to me, having been working with them for a while,
but may not be as helpful to someone unfamilar with the borrowed concepts,
to whom it may seem like giberish, or to someone familar with the borrowed concepts,
to whom the way I twist the standard concepts may be confusing.

Chris also had an explaination of boundaries in terms of infinitesimals,
(so maybe I should also define a qtl::epsilon, and overload 
boundary operator+(scalar,epsilon)
boundary operator-(scalar,epsilon)
for constructing boundaries)

Since different ways of representing boundaries or intervals may seem more or less intuitive or systematic
to different people, there are different output flags (analogous to std::ios_base::fmtflags)
for selecting the way operator<< prints them to qtl::ostream, but my choices may not have
been the ones easiest to explain (or the choiches I would have made if I were making them now)
So some of the c++ interface might want to change if there is a tweak that would make them
more documentable for others.
